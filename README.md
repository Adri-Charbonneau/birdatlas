# BirdsAtlas
This site is an aid to fieldwork for the atlas of breeding birds of France ([Oiseaux de France](https://oiseauxdefrance.org/)): it simply combines available data ([Oiseaux de France](https://oiseauxdefrance.org/) and [Cocheurs](https://www.cocheurs.fr/)) in a readable format in order to guide research and improve species knowledge.

Errors are absolutely not excluded (whether of substance or form), do not hesitate to bring this up by creating an [issue](https://github.com/A-d-r-i/birdsatlas/issues).
